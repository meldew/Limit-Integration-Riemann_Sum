# Riemann_Integration

This is my Integration test file

Calculates Limit Integral using Reimanns sum Right rule
where a and b are integral limits and N are number of iterations of the sum(numer of Rectangles)
Calculates result, and plot two plot where the first plot illustrates Rectangles on the graph and the
second plot illustrates the overall area under the function
